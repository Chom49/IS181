          As we see in the video Dar es Salaam is grappled with flooding issues.
          Intense rainfall inundated the city, overwhelming its drainage
          systems. The low-lying coastal areas and numerous rivers exacerbated
          the situation, leading to widespread waterlogging in many
          neighborhoods. The rapid urbanization of Dar es Salaam had intensified
          the problem. Poorly planned land development and inadequate
          infrastructure exacerbated the impact of heavy rains. Solid waste and
          informal settlements obstructed waterways, worsening the flooding.
          Each downpour posed significant risks: properties were damaged,
          residents were displaced, and transportation and public services
          ground to a halt. Furthermore, the increased risk of waterborne
          diseases loomed over the population, threatening public health.

          occurred in Elgeyo Marakwet county, approximately 400 kilometers (250
          miles) northwest of the capital, Nairobi. The ill-fated helicopter was
          carrying a total of 11 military personnel, including General Ogolla.
          Regrettably, only two individuals survived the crash1. General Ogolla
          was a gallant officer who had dedicated his life to serving his
          country. He had taken up the position of Chief of Defence Forces in
          April of the previous year, following his tenure as the commander of
          the air force and
